		    <h3>What is Computer Science?</h3>
			<label class="line"></label>
			<p>Computer Science is the science of using computers to solve problems. Learning computer science empowers individuals to design solutions to problems that make a real difference in people's lives.</p>
            <p>Computer science is about so much more than programming— it requires critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, and teamwork. In addition to being used in the technology sector at companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, computer science plays a huge role in all sorts of other industries. From business, to medicine, to engineering, to politics, to art— computer science is everywhere!</p>
            <p>If you're looking for more information on computer science and what you can do with it, <a href="https://www.code.org">Code.org</a> has some great resources. You can start with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1mafeosi0xuwb0/What_is_CS_and_Careers.pdf">this document</a> and the video below.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.

			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<label class="line"></label>
            <h6>Do I need previous programming experience to join App Academy?</h6>
            <p>Absolutely not! Most of our incoming 9th grade students are completely new to programming. You'll be surprised how fast you pick it up! We encourage any interested student who meets our entrance requirements to apply.</p>
            <h6>Can I be in band, JROTC, or take AP classes if I'm in App Academy?</h6>
            <p>Yes! Many of our current students are active in extracurricular activities and AP courses. The PHS counselors do their best to accommodate each individual student's needs when scheduling classes.</p>
            <h6>Do I need my own laptop for App Academy?</h6>
            <p>No, we'll provide you with one! </p>
            <h6>What if I'm still not sure that computer science is for me?</h6>
            <p>The great thing about learning computer science is that it connects with almost every other field out there! To get an idea of how CS can be used, check out the resources at <a href="http://dotdiva.org/passion.html">dotdiva.org</a>. If you're looking to try out programming for yourself, you could try out an Hour of Code with <a href="https://code.org/learn">code.org</a>. If you're still having fun, check out Khan Academy's courses on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">making webpages with HTML/CSS</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">drawing and animation in JavaScript</a>!</p>
            <h6>How does App Academy prepare students for success in college and future careers?</h6>
            <p>Our world is increasingly driven by technology, and the skill of computer programming is in high demand. In addition to learning programming, App Academy students will build on their critical thinking and problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, and communication skills. Students will hear from a diverse group of guest speakers who use programming in their careers, and also have the opportunity to visit colleges and workplaces.</p>
